Objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using `const`  
are still mutable. `const` only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.  
For example:

```javascript
"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
```

To really prevent object mutation, using `Object.freeze`.

```javascript
let obj = {
  name: "FreeCodeCamp",
  review: "Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj);
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}
```

Notice: any attempt at changing the object (adding, updating, deleting) will be  
rejected without throwing any error.
Show case:

```javascript
function freezeObj() {
  "use strict";
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
  // change code below this line

  Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  // change code above this line
  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch (ex) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();
```
