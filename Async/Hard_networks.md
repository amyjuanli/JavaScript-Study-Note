## Transmission failure 
It happens when a signal is sent but never received for whatever reason. 
Often transmission failures are random accidents. Simply retry sending the request
may cause it to succeed. 
```javascript
class Timeout extends Error {}

function request(nest, target, type, content) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let done = false;
    function attempt(n) {
      nest.send(target, type, content, (failed, value) => {
        done = true;
        if (failed) reject(failed);
        else resolve(value);
      });
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (done) return;
        else if (n < 3) attempt(n + 1);
        else reject(new Timeout("Timed out"));
      }, 250);
    }
    attempt(1);
  });
}
```
